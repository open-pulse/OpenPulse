class LoadingWindow(QWidget):
    """
    This function is intended to be called for functions that take
    a long time to run and should run together with a progress bar.

    The indended use is explained in the following example:
    ```
    def long_function(param_a, param_b=0):
        ...
        return value_c
    ```

    To run this function with a progress bar you just need to write
    ```
    value_c = LoadingWindow(long_function, param_a, param_b=1234)
    ```

    Disclaimers:
    This is a monstruosity, but it works.
    I hope no one ever needs to modify it.
    I am trying my best to explain every part of this code.

    An easier way to do it would be using a QWorker and a QThread,
    but it does not work for our Application.
    Qt manages the windows in the main thread, therefore the function
    to be loaded would need to run in a secondary thread.
    The problem is GMSH (wow, what a surprise).

    GMSH, for some reason, refuses to run in secondary thread.
    And GMSH is an important part of our software, that of course
    need a progress bar when it is running.
    So this is an attempt to run everything (both GMSH and QT) in the
    main thread without conflicts.

    I also don't want to mix the interface code with the engine code
    because it can easily became a mess and make the creation of
    automated tests really hard.
